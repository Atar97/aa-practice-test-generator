Welcome to a/A Practice 01Assessment Generator 2.0
This generator will create a practice test based on your input.
You can choose how many problems from each category to include in your test.
This program will generate 3 files in this folder: practice_test, spec, and solution.
Complete the practice_test file, running the spec file to check your answers.
When your time is up (you are timing yourself, right?), compare your answers to the solutions.
Good luck!
